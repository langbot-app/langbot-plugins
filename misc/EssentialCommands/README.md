## Shared runtime

This release declares `shared-runtime-v1` / `stateless-v1`: the configured
language is resolved per invocation and the plugin keeps no tenant state in
process memory. See [SHARED_RUNTIME.md](SHARED_RUNTIME.md) for the details and
the known limits. It is not a certification claim.
