"""Installation- and memory-scope-scoped storage write lock and reconciliation fence.

One workspace installs this plugin once, and the same installation object graph is
reused by several product objects, so locks and fences are keyed by
``(installation binding, memory scope identity)``: an ambiguous failure for one
memory scope never blocks the other scopes that share the installation.

The identity is the dimension :class:`store.memory_store.MemoryStore` groups its
records by: ``scope_key`` for the L1 records (session/subject scope, see
``MemoryStore.get_scope_key``) and the collection id for the L2 episodes.  The
installation-wide ``kb_configs`` map carries no per-object identity, so it is
serialized on the installation scope instead.

Only a Host mutation that was dispatched with an unknown outcome fences a scope:
a deterministic error raised before the call, an error detected after the Host
answered authoritatively, and ordinary cancellation before dispatch do not.
Fences are persisted in installation-bound Host storage (the key folds in the
scope identity) behind an in-process cache, so a restarted worker still
recognises them, and process-local state is released when the installation is
revoked.
