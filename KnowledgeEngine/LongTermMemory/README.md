# LongTermMemory

Long-term memory plugin for LangBot with a dual-layer design:

- L1 core profile injected into the system prompt
- L2 episodic memory retrieved through vector search and injected into context

## What It Does

- Exposes a `remember` tool for episodic memory writes
- Exposes a `recall_memory` tool for active episodic memory lookup with controlled filters
- Exposes an `update_profile` tool for stable profile updates
- Exposes a `forget` tool for agent-initiated deletion of specific episodic memories
- Injects profile memory and current speaker identity through an EventListener
- Uses an EventListener to retrieve and inject relevant episodic memories before model invocation
- Provides a `!memory` command for inspection and debugging
- Provides a web **Memory Console** page for visual inspection: profiles, episodes (with pagination), audit log, exports, a metadata-isolation health check, and the last memory-injection snapshot
- Provides `!memory list [page]` to browse episodic memories with pagination
- Provides `!memory forget <episode_id>` to delete a specific episode
- Provides `!memory search <query>` to search episodes (results include episode IDs)
- Provides `!memory health` to verify KB configuration and metadata-filter isolation
- Provides a `!memory export` command to export L1 profiles for the current session as JSON
- Provides `!memory export l2`, `!memory import l2 <json>`, and scoped `!memory delete` commands for L2 governance
- Provides `!memory audit [page|export]` to inspect scoped memory change history
- Provides `!memory consolidate preview|run` for preview-first scoped L2 cleanup
- Provides optional `!memory candidates` and `!memory candidate accept|reject` review workflow for extracted memory candidates
- Automatically supersedes related older episodes when a correction/fact-update/clarification is stored

## Overall Design

This plugin is not trying to dump the entire chat history into context. Instead, it splits long-term memory into two layers with different storage and retrieval behavior:

- **L1 core profile**: stable, low-frequency facts such as names, preferences, identity, and long-lived notes
- **L2 episodic memory**: time-sensitive and situational facts such as recent events, plans, and experiences

This split exists for a reason:

- Stable profile data is cheap and reliable to inject into the system prompt
- Episodic memory keeps growing over time, so it should be retrieved on demand instead of fully injected every turn
- Agents should update stable profile facts differently from event-like memories

## How This Differs From OpenClaw-Style Personal Assistant Memory

Recently, a lot of agent systems have discussed designs like OpenClaw: long-term memory stored primarily as user-readable text files such as `MEMORY.md`, combined with summaries, reflection, and light retrieval logic.

That approach has clear strengths:

- memory is fully transparent to the user
- plain text is naturally easy to back up, sync, and version-control
- it fits single-user, single-assistant, high-continuity personal workflows very well
- when memory volume stays small, full-text understanding can indeed be "good enough"

But LongTermMemory in LangBot is solving a different problem. Typical LangBot deployment looks more like:

- one bot serving multiple group chats and private chats
- one plugin instance handling multiple sessions and multiple speakers
- memory including shared group context, current-speaker profile, and session-level episodic facts
- explicit isolation boundaries between sessions, bots, and speakers

Because of that, we did not adopt a "single text file as the source of truth" design. We chose a layered architecture that better matches LangBot's multi-session runtime model.

### What OpenClaw-like memory is optimized for

Abstractly, that design is optimized for:

- **single-user personal assistants**
- **human-readable text as the primary long-term memory form**
- **transparency, editability, and narrative continuity**
- **an assumption that memory size stays manageable and the user is willing to curate it directly**

That is a very reasonable fit for personal AI companions, research copilots, and private assistant workflows.

### Why LangBot does not simply copy that model

LongTermMemory is designed around different operating constraints: multiple sessions, multiple speakers, explicit isolation, controlled injection, and retrievable episodic recall.

If we turned long-term memory into one narrative file like `MEMORY.md`, several problems would appear quickly:

- **Isolation would become hard**
  - how should memories from group A, group B, and private chat C coexist safely?
  - how do you cleanly separate one speaker's stable profile from a shared narrative log?
- **Injection granularity would become unstable**
  - system prompts need stable profile state, not an entire chronological diary
  - automatic recall needs the most relevant memory slices for the current query, not the whole story
- **Multi-user boundaries are first-class in LangBot**
  - in a personal assistant, "the user" is usually one person
  - in LangBot, current speaker, current session, and current bot all matter
- **Automatic injection and active retrieval are different needs**
  - stable profile data should be injected consistently
  - episodic memory should be retrieved selectively
  - forcing both into one text-only memory shape becomes awkward

### The tradeoff we made

So the LongTermMemory design is essentially this tradeoff:

- **What we borrow from that philosophy**
  - memory should not be treated as only a black-box vector store
  - stable profile, temporal memory, and long-term behavior adjustment all matter
  - not everything should be dumped into context every turn

- **Where we deliberately differ**
  - we do not use a narrative text diary as the only memory source of truth
  - we split stable profile and episodic memory explicitly
  - we prioritize isolation across sessions, speakers, and bots
  - we let L2 memory plug naturally into LangBot's KB / retrieval system instead of relying only on full-text reading

In short:

- OpenClaw is mainly answering: "How should a personal assistant keep readable, editable, reflective long-term memory?"
- LongTermMemory is mainly answering: "How should a bot working across groups and private chats keep stable profile state and retrievable experience memory under explicit isolation rules?"

Neither direction is universally "better". They optimize for different products and different failure modes.

## Design

This plugin intentionally stays close to LangBot's existing extension points instead of requiring custom core patches.

- L1 profile is stored in plugin storage as JSON
- L2 episodic memory is stored in the vector database
- Memory retrieval is enabled per pipeline by attaching this plugin's KnowledgeEngine
- The plugin currently assumes a single memory KB per plugin instance and isolates memory by metadata

The current implementation is built around the existing LangBot and SDK APIs. If LangBot later adds more explicit memory-oriented APIs, session identity APIs, or KB registration APIs, the plugin could be simplified, but the current architecture would still remain valid.

### Vector Database Backend Compatibility

L2 episodic memory relies on arbitrary metadata fields (`user_key`, `episode_id`, `tags`, `importance`, etc.) for isolation and filtering. Not all LangBot vector database backends support arbitrary metadata:

| Backend | Arbitrary metadata | LongTermMemory support |
|---------|-------------------|----------------------|
| **Chroma** (default) | Yes | Full support |
| **Qdrant** | Yes | Full support |
| **SeekDB** | Yes | Full support |
| **Milvus** | No (fixed schema: `text`, `file_id`, `chunk_uuid`) | Not supported |
| **pgvector** | No (fixed schema: `text`, `file_id`, `chunk_uuid`) | Not supported |

Milvus and pgvector use a fixed column schema and silently drop metadata fields they do not recognize. This means metadata-based isolation (`user_key` filtering) and episodic memory commands (`!memory list`, `!memory forget`, `!memory search`) will not work correctly on these backends — filters will be ignored and queries may return unscoped results.

If you need to use LongTermMemory, use Chroma, Qdrant, or SeekDB as your vector database backend.

After configuring the memory knowledge base, run `!memory health` in a pipeline that uses that knowledge base. The health check verifies that the KB is present, active in the current pipeline, has an embedding model, and can use metadata filters to keep two temporary `user_key` probe records isolated. If this command reports metadata-filter leakage, the backend is not safe for scoped LongTermMemory recall.

## How It Works

An end-to-end long-term memory flow has four main parts:

### 1. L1 profile writes

- The agent uses `update_profile` to write stable facts
- Data is stored in plugin storage as structured JSON
- Profiles are stored at either `session` or `speaker` scope

### 2. L2 episodic writes

- The agent uses `remember` to write event-like memory
- Each memory carries metadata such as timestamp, importance, tags, and scope
- Those memories are embedded and stored in the vector database through the plugin's KnowledgeEngine

### 3. Automatic pre-response injection

- During `PromptPreProcessing`, the EventListener resolves the current session identity
- For L1:
  - it loads the shared session profile
  - it loads the current speaker profile
  - it injects both, along with current speaker identity, into `default_prompt`
- For L2:
  - it runs one episodic retrieval using the current user message
  - retrieved memories are injected as factual context blocks

So both L1 and L2 enter the model context before answer generation, but in different forms: L1 as system prompt memory, L2 as retrieved context.

### 4. Active lookup and debugging

- If automatic injection is insufficient, the agent can call `recall_memory`
- For inspection and debugging, you can use `!memory`, `!memory profile`, `!memory search`, `!memory list`, and `!memory forget`
- `!memory export` exports only the current scope's L1 profiles for backup or migration

## Memory Write Policy

Write L1 profile memory when the fact is stable, low-frequency, and currently valid:

- names, identities, long-term preferences, communication style
- durable speaker facts in private chat, such as "Alice prefers concise technical answers"
- durable group/session conventions, such as "This group coordinates the LangBot release"
- explicit corrections to current stable facts

Write L2 episodic memory when the fact has time, history, or situational value:

- plans, deadlines, recent status, decisions, and events
- private chat example: "Alice said her Tokyo flight is next Tuesday"
- group chat example: "Bob agreed to own the database migration this week"
- correction history when the timeline matters

Write nothing when the content is not useful or should not be stored:

- one-off greetings, jokes, small talk, or facts only needed for the current answer
- secrets, credentials, API keys, one-time codes, and private tokens
- unconfirmed sensitive claims, third-party private gossip, or harmful inferred labels

Correction rule: update L1 for the corrected current fact. If the correction itself is historically important, also write an L2 episode describing the correction. Do not keep contradictory L1 profile values active in parallel.

## Relationship With AgenticRAG

When AgenticRAG is enabled together with LongTermMemory:

- LongTermMemory removes its own memory KB from naive RAG pre-processing
- automatic L2 recall is still handled by LongTermMemory itself
- the same memory KB can still be queried explicitly through AgenticRAG's `query_knowledge` tool

This avoids duplicate recall while preserving both paths:

- automatic memory recall
- deeper agent-initiated retrieval when needed

## Why There Is No Agent-Side Metadata Filter

The underlying runtime can support metadata filtering, but this plugin does not expose arbitrary raw metadata filters to the agent flow today.

Reasons:

- Different knowledge engines and vector backends do not share one unified metadata schema
- Filter field names, value formats, and supported operators may differ
- The agent currently has no stable schema source for constructing reliable filters

If LangBot later provides a unified way to describe filterable metadata fields per knowledge base, agent-side metadata filtering can be added.

This plugin does provide a controlled recall tool surface for its own stable memory schema. That tool supports selected filters such as speaker and time range, without exposing free-form backend-specific filter syntax to the model.

## Isolation Model

Two isolation modes are supported:

- `session`: each group chat or private chat has independent memory
- `bot`: all sessions under the same bot share memory

In the current deployment model, this is generally sufficient because plugin instances are usually bound to a specific LangBot runtime/bot environment.

## Isolation Rules In Detail

There are two related but slightly different scope concepts in this plugin:

- **session_name**: the conversation identity passed through the current query / retrieval path, formatted as `{launcher_type}_{launcher_id}`
- **session_key**: the plugin's internal L1 storage key. When `bot_uuid` is available, it becomes `{bot_uuid}:{launcher_type}_{launcher_id}`; otherwise it falls back to `{launcher_type}_{launcher_id}`
- **scope_key / user_key**: the actual key used for profile storage or L2 retrieval isolation

### How L1 profiles are isolated

L1 profiles are always stored within the current conversation scope:

- `session profile`
  - shared profile for the current conversation
  - useful for group-level or conversation-level stable context
- `speaker profile`
  - stable facts about the current speaker
  - useful for person-specific preferences, identity, and notes

Because of that, `!memory export` exports only the profiles that belong to the current `session_key`, not every profile in the whole plugin instance.

### How L2 episodic memory is isolated

L2 memories are written into the vector store with isolation metadata, then filtered at retrieval time:

- `session`
  - memories from group A are not recalled in group B
  - memories from one private chat are not recalled in another
- `bot`
  - all sessions under the same bot share one episodic memory space
  - useful when you want cross-session long-term experience sharing

When `sender_id` is available, the plugin can also prefer speaker-related memories before widening to the broader scope.

### Why L1 and L2 isolation are not exactly the same

That is intentional:

- L1 behaves like stable profile state, so precise session / speaker storage makes sense
- L2 behaves like a retrievable experience base, so metadata-based filtering is the more scalable model
- this keeps L1 precise and L2 flexible

## How To Use

1. Install and enable the plugin.
2. Create one memory knowledge base with this plugin's KnowledgeEngine.
3. Configure:
   - `embedding_model_uuid`
   - `isolation`
   - optional `recency_half_life_days`
   - optional `auto_recall_top_k`
4. Let the agent use:
   - `remember` for events, plans, and episodic facts
   - `recall_memory` for active memory lookup when automatic recall is insufficient
   - `update_profile` for stable preferences and profile data
   - `forget` to delete a specific episodic memory by ID
5. Run `!memory health` in a pipeline that includes the memory KB. Treat `ERROR` as a setup problem before relying on scoped recall.
6. Use `!memory`, `!memory profile`, `!memory search <query>`, `!memory list [page]`, `!memory forget <id>`, `!memory export`, and `!memory consolidate preview` to inspect behavior. `!memory list` and `!memory search` show active episodes by default; add `--include-superseded`, `--include-archived`, or `--status <status>` when explicitly inspecting hidden lifecycle states.

## Episode Lifecycle

L2 episodes carry a lifecycle `status` metadata field:

- `active`: default state for new episodes and eligible for normal recall
- `superseded`: replaced by a newer correction or fact update
- `archived`: retained for history, excluded from normal recall
- `deleted`: reserved for tombstones or future audit workflows

Existing records without `status` are treated as `active`, so no migration is required. Automatic recall and `recall_memory` only return active episodes by default. Correction-style writes mark similar older active episodes as `superseded`, which keeps them inspectable through explicit management commands without letting them compete with current memory.

## Audit Log

Memory-changing operations write scoped audit entries to plugin storage, not to the L2 vector database. Audit entries include the operation, target, scope key, user key, sender identity when available, timestamp, query id, and a short summary.

Use `!memory audit [page]` to inspect recent entries for the current scope, or `!memory audit export` to export only the current scope's audit log as JSON.

## Managing Hidden Episodes

Use `!memory show <episode_id>` to inspect one episode, including status, sender, source, tags, importance, and supersede metadata. Use `!memory superseded [page]` and `!memory archived [page]` to inspect records hidden from normal recall. Use `!memory archive <episode_id>` to hide an active episode without deleting it, and `!memory restore <episode_id>` to make an archived or superseded episode active again. Archive and restore operations write audit entries.

## Memory Consolidation

Use `!memory consolidate preview` to inspect cleanup candidates for the current scope. Preview never modifies memory. It reports candidate episode IDs, a deterministic summary episode proposal, possible profile updates, episodes that would be archived, and risk notes.

Use `!memory consolidate run` only after setting `consolidation_enabled=true` on the memory knowledge base. Run applies only the current `user_key` scope. It can archive selected active or superseded episodes and write one summary episode tagged `consolidation` and `summary`. Every archive and summary write creates scoped audit entries. Profile update application is disabled by default through `consolidation_apply_profile_updates=false`.

Relevant knowledge base settings:

- `consolidation_enabled`: default `false`; required for `run`
- `consolidation_min_age_days`: default `7`
- `consolidation_max_candidates`: default `20`
- `consolidation_apply_profile_updates`: default `false`

## Memory Candidate Extraction

Candidate extraction is disabled by default because automatic memory writes can pollute both L1 profiles and L2 episodic recall, especially in group chats. Enable it only when you want a review queue for possible memory writes:

- `candidate_extraction_enabled`: default `false`
- `candidate_auto_apply`: default `false`
- `candidate_max_per_turn`: default `3`

When enabled, the plugin listens to the existing `NormalMessageResponded` event and stores conservative memory candidates for the current scope. Candidates do not modify L1 or L2 unless accepted. Use `!memory candidates [page]` to list pending candidates, `!memory candidates --all-statuses` to inspect accepted and rejected candidates, `!memory candidate accept <candidate_id>` to apply one candidate through the normal profile or episode write path, and `!memory candidate reject <candidate_id>` to keep a rejected candidate inspectable without writing memory.

Keep `candidate_auto_apply=false` for normal deployments. If `candidate_auto_apply=true`, extracted candidates are accepted immediately and audit entries are written, but this increases the risk of low-value or ambiguous facts entering long-term memory.

## Retrieval Strategy

The memory KB supports `retrieval_strategy` values `auto`, `vector`, and `hybrid`. `auto` tries hybrid search with `query_text` and falls back to vector search if the backend does not support hybrid mode. `vector` is the compatibility mode. `exact_match_boost` boosts exact matches on episode IDs, sender identity, tags, and content snippets; searching by an exact episode ID can return that episode without relying on embedding similarity.

## Context Sharing for Other Plugins

LongTermMemory writes a structured context summary to the query variable `_ltm_context` during every `PromptPreProcessing` event. Other plugins can read this variable to make programmatic decisions based on user memory, without importing or referencing LongTermMemory in any way.

### Variable Key

`_ltm_context`

### Schema

```python
{
    "speaker": {
        "id": "user_123",           # sender_id, may be empty string
        "name": "Alice",            # sender_name, may be empty string
    },
    "session_profile": {            # always present, fields may be empty
        "name": "",
        "traits": ["creative", "analytical"],
        "preferences": ["prefers detailed explanations"],
        "notes": "",
        "updated_at": "2025-03-16T12:00:00Z",
    },
    "speaker_profile": {            # null when sender_id is unavailable
        "name": "Alice",
        "traits": ["extroverted"],
        "preferences": ["likes humor"],
        "notes": "",
        "updated_at": "2025-03-16T12:00:00Z",
    },
    "episodes": [                   # auto-recalled L2 episodic memories, may be empty
        {"content": "User mentioned a trip to Beijing last week"},
    ],
}
```

### Usage Example

```python
from langbot_plugin.api.definition.components.common.event_listener import EventListener
from langbot_plugin.api.entities import events, context
from langbot_plugin.api.entities.builtin.provider.message import Message


class PersonalityCustomizer(EventListener):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()

        @self.handler(events.PromptPreProcessing)
        async def on_prompt(event_ctx: context.EventContext):
            ltm = await event_ctx.get_query_var("_ltm_context")
            if not ltm:
                # LongTermMemory not installed or inactive — use defaults
                return

            profile = ltm.get("speaker_profile") or ltm.get("session_profile") or {}
            traits = profile.get("traits", [])

            if "喜欢幽默" in traits:
                style = "Use a humorous and playful tone."
            elif "偏好简洁" in traits:
                style = "Be concise and direct."
            else:
                return

            event_ctx.event.default_prompt.append(
                Message(role="system", content=style)
            )
```

### Design Notes

- If LongTermMemory is not installed, `_ltm_context` does not exist. Consuming plugins should treat `None` as normal and fall back to default behavior.
- If LongTermMemory is active but no profile data has been stored yet, the variable exists with empty fields. This lets consuming plugins distinguish "no memory plugin" from "memory plugin active, no data yet".
- Both sides depend only on the variable key and schema convention, not on each other's code. If LongTermMemory is replaced by another memory plugin that writes the same key with the same schema, consuming plugins continue to work.
- LongTermMemory must run before consuming plugins in the event dispatch order. In practice this depends on plugin installation order.

## Import / Export

- **Export (L1 profiles):** Use `!memory export` to export the current scope's session and speaker profiles as JSON. It does not export data from other sessions or scopes.
- **Export (L2 episodic memory):** Use `!memory export l2` to export all L2 episodes for the current `user_key` scope. Add `--status <active|superseded|archived|deleted>` or `--include-archived` / `--include-superseded` to narrow the exported lifecycle states.
- **Import (L2 episodic memory):** Use `!memory import l2 <json>` with either a JSON list of episodes or an object containing an `episodes` list. Imported records are always written into the current scope's `user_key`; any `user_key` in the JSON is ignored and original episode IDs are preserved only as import metadata so another scope cannot be overwritten.
- **Bulk delete (L2 episodic memory):** Use `!memory delete --speaker <sender_id>`, `!memory delete --tag <tag>`, `!memory delete --before <timestamp>`, or `!memory delete --status <status>`. Bulk deletion first enumerates the current `user_key` scope, deletes only matching scoped records, reports the affected count, and writes audit entries.
- **L2 episodic memory can also be browsed** via `!memory list [page]`; individual episodes can be deleted via `!memory forget <id>`.

## Key Technical Q&A

### Q1. Why split memory into L1 and L2 instead of storing everything in the vector database?

Because the access patterns are different:

- L1 contains stable facts and should be injected consistently
- L2 contains event-like memory and should be retrieved on demand

Putting both into the vector store would make stable profile recall less reliable and make memory updates semantically messy.

### Q2. Why is L2 retrieved instead of fully injected every turn?

Because L2 grows over time. Full injection would quickly cause:

- prompt bloat
- too much irrelevant noise
- old memory crowding out the actually relevant context

The current strategy is to retrieve a small relevant subset automatically, then let the agent use `recall_memory` if it needs more.

### Q3. Does L2 memory decay over time?

Yes.

L2 ranking does not depend only on vector similarity. It also applies time decay so that newer memories tend to rank higher than older ones.

The current implementation uses a half-life style approach:

- when a memory reaches `half_life_days`, its time weight decays to roughly 50%
- newer memory is favored in ranking
- older memory is not deleted automatically; it just loses ranking advantage

This is meant to prioritize recent context, not to hard-delete the past.

### Q4. Do old memories eventually disappear completely?

Not automatically.

Time decay affects ranking, not hard deletion. Old memories can still be recalled if they remain relevant enough.

### Q5. How should I choose between `session` and `bot` isolation?

In practice:

- choose `session`
  - when each group chat / private chat should keep independent memory
  - when you want lower risk of cross-session leakage
- choose `bot`
  - when the bot should share long-term experience across sessions
  - when broader recall is more important than stricter separation

If you are unsure, start with `session`.

### Q6. Why does `!memory export` only export the current scope?

That is a deliberate safety boundary.

Allowing export of every L1 profile in the plugin instance would make cross-session data leakage much easier. Restricting export to the current scope follows a minimum-exposure principle.

### Q7. What happens if the runtime does not expose `_knowledge_base_uuids` in query variables?

Automatic memory injection still works, but the plugin cannot remove its memory KB from naive RAG pre-processing.

That can lead to duplicate memory recall:

- one copy injected by LongTermMemory itself
- another copy recalled again by the runner's generic KB flow

So this is not a full failure, but it can waste context and make the prompt noisier.

### Q8. How are L2 exports and imports scoped?

`!memory export l2` exports only the current `user_key` scope. `!memory import l2 <json>` also writes only into the current `user_key` scope, regardless of any `user_key` fields included in the JSON. Imported records receive new episode IDs; the original IDs are kept as import metadata for traceability.

### Q9. Will LongTermMemory and AgenticRAG duplicate recall when both are enabled?

No, that duplication is exactly what the current design avoids:

- LongTermMemory removes its own naive RAG pre-processing
- automatic L2 recall is handled by LongTermMemory
- deeper ad hoc retrieval can still go through AgenticRAG

## Current Gaps

The README now covers the core design, isolation rules, export boundaries, and major components.

Still worth adding later:

- synchronized updates for localized docs
- concrete JSON import examples
- best-practice examples for `remember`, `recall_memory`, and `update_profile`

## Memory Console

In addition to the `!memory` command surface, the plugin ships a web **Memory Console** page (registered under the plugin's Page component) for visual inspection and maintenance. It talks to the plugin through scoped page endpoints and never escapes the selected memory space.

The console is organized into a scope sidebar plus tabbed panels:

- **Memory Space sidebar** — pick a known scope, or fill in `bot_uuid` / `session_name` / `isolation` and click **Derive** to compute the matching `scope_key` and `user_key`. An **Advanced / Raw** area exposes the underlying keys for power users.
- **Profiles** — view the session profile and the current speaker profile for the selected scope.
- **Episodes** — list (paginated) or semantic-search L2 episodes for the current `user_key`, filtered by lifecycle status; archive, restore, or delete individual episodes inline. Every mutating action writes a scoped audit entry, exactly like the equivalent `!memory` command.
- **Injection** — load the **last memory-injection snapshot** for the scope: whether anything was injected on the latest turn, how many blocks and characters, which speaker, the session/speaker profiles that were used, and the L2 episodes that were auto-recalled. This answers "what did the bot actually remember on the last turn?" without scraping logs.
- **Audit** — browse (paginated) and export the scoped audit log.
- **Export** — export L1 profiles and L2 episodes for the current scope as JSON.
- **Diagnostics** — **Run Health Check** executes the same metadata-isolation probe as `!memory health` directly from the UI (KB config, embedding model, and `user_key` filter isolation on search / list / delete), rendered as red/amber/green status cards. Use this before trusting scoped recall, especially on backends listed as unsupported above. Note: the console cannot verify that the KB is attached to a specific pipeline — run `!memory health` inside a pipeline to confirm that part.

The console is i18n-aware (`en_US`, `zh_Hans`) and follows the host LangBot light/dark theme.

## Logging

The plugin now emits logs at key memory lifecycle points so you can observe how long-term memory is being used during runtime.

You will see logs for:

- plugin initialization and resolved memory context
- `remember`, `recall_memory`, and `update_profile` tool calls
- profile injection before model invocation
- automatic L2 memory retrieval in the KnowledgeEngine
- episodic memory vector writes, searches, import batches, and deletes

Beyond logs, the most recent profile injection and L2 recall for each scope are also persisted as a structured snapshot and surfaced in the Memory Console's **Injection** tab, so you can inspect runtime behavior visually instead of only through log scraping.

Typical log messages look like:

```text
[LongTermMemory] remember called: query_id=123 params_keys=['content', 'importance', 'tags']
[LongTermMemory] memory injection ready: query_id=123 kb_id=kb-1 scope_key=bot:xxx:group_123 sender_id=u1 block_count=2 prompt_chars=280
[LongTermMemory] engine retrieve called: collection_id=kb-1 top_k=5 session_name=group_123 sender_id=u1 bot_uuid=bot-1 query='user asked about travel plan'
[LongTermMemory] search_episodes completed: collection_id=kb-1 result_count=3 filters={'user_key': 'bot:bot-1:group_123'}
```
