"""Installation- and knowledge-base-scoped state for LangRAG.

Locks and fences are keyed by ``(installation binding, knowledge-base identity)``
so an ambiguous failure for one knowledge base never blocks the other knowledge
bases that share the same installation. The platform storage key spans a whole
installation, so the knowledge-base id is always folded into our keys.

Only a dispatched mutation whose outcome is unknown fences: a validation error
raised before any call is dispatched, and ordinary cancellation before dispatch,
do not. A caller that goes away while its mutation is already in flight can
never observe the outcome, so that fences too, and it fences in the same step as
the cancellation so sibling operations fail closed instead of queueing behind
the unsettled mutation. A reply that does not say what happened to the rows is
an unknown outcome for the same reason. Fences are persisted (key includes the
knowledge-base identity) behind an in-process cache, so a restarted worker still
recognises them.
