"""Installation- and knowledge-base-scoped state using the SDK-bound Host proxy.

Bundled in each independent archive. No filesystem/global tenant registry.

Locks and fences are keyed by ``(installation binding, knowledge-base identity)``
so an ambiguous failure for one knowledge base never blocks the other knowledge
bases that share the same installation; the platform storage key is the same for
a whole installation, hence the knowledge-base id is always folded into our keys.
Fences are persisted in installation-bound Host storage (key includes the
knowledge-base id) with an in-process cache in front, so a restarted worker still
recognises them. Only dispatched mutations whose outcome is unknown fence; a
deterministic validation error raised before any remote call and ordinary
cancellation before a call is dispatched do not. A fence that cannot be
persisted aborts the mutation before it is dispatched, and a fence is released
only after the provider answer was confirmed and its Host record written.
