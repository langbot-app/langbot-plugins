# Shared runtime source candidate (SDK >=0.7.4)

This source declares shared-runtime-v1 and stateless-v1. It is not certified or a claim of live vendor acceptance.
The exact archive requires independent review, signer approval, and two-Workspace invocation acceptance.

- Configuration and credentials are read per invocation. No SDK process-global
  settings are modified.
- Host-managed state and the SDK connection binding supply authority. User config
  strings and adapter business parameters are not tenant identity.
- Explicit HTTP(S) self-hosted endpoints remain supported, including private service
  addresses. Endpoint validation is syntax validation, NOT an SSRF/network sandbox.
  Shared deployments MUST enforce their own egress policy against metadata/control
  endpoints and foreign tenant services. Do not certify a deployment without that
  network-policy evidence. Environment HTTP proxies are no longer implicitly inherited.
- Redirects are not followed by HTTP clients. Configure the final endpoint/attachment
  URL; redirect-dependent workflows must update their URL rather than forwarding
  credentials to an unreviewed destination.
- Tests use installed SDK types and actual local transports/processes, with explicitly
  simulated vendor replies. They are not paid/live vendor-account tests.

## Optional asset gateway

The listener belongs to the SDK-created Runner component (one per artifact), not
a process-global SDK singleton. Concurrent runs with identical host/port/timeout
share the component listener, with distinct revocable invocation capabilities and expiring tokens. Last release
closes the listener and drains accepted tasks. Conflicting fixed-port settings fail
instead of silently reusing or mutating an active listener. Separate installations require an explicit ingress route to their individual run tokens.
Limits: 16 accepted connections, 16 KiB headers, 1 MiB request/response, 32-message
MCP batches, finite request timeout <=120s and token TTL <=3600s. Tool RPC cancellation
does not promise rollback of an already-dispatched Host operation.
